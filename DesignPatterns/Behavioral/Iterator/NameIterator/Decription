Iterator Pattern is the pattern that is concerned with the traverse from one
element to the other in collection without exposing the type of representation.
(list, stack, tree, etc.).

Iterator pattern is useful when the extraction of element is necessary from a
complex data structure like Tree by separating the extraction the traversal
behavior of a collection into a separate object called "iterator".
