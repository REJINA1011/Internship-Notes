Memento Pattern is used to restore the state of an object to the previous state.

In the code, there are 3 actor classes:
    CareTaker       :the class is responsible to restore the object state from Memento
                     class.
    Memento         :the class contains states of the object that are to be restored
    Originator      :the class is responsible to create and store states in Memento
                     objects.
